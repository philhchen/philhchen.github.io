		<p>Hi, I'm an undergraduate at Stanford University studying math and computer science. My research interests include building mathematical models for natural phenomena and making stabs at understanding foundations of statistical learning systems. </p>
		<p>In my free time, I enjoy cycling, violin, and conducting (orchestras, not electricity). The "media" page contains videos of my violin glory days when I used to have time to practice.</p>
		<p>Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions!</p>
