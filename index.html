		<p>Hi, I'm Phil, and I'm a student at University High School. 
		My interests include just about everything related to math or science. I've been researching breast cancer populations for the past two years at UC Irvine's Center for Mathematical and Computational Biology.</p>
		<p>My other passion is violin, and I've posted videos of my performances under "Media"</p>
		<p>Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions!</p>
