		<p>Hi, I'm an undergraduate at Stanford University studying math and computer science. My research interests include building mathematical models for natural phenomena and making stabs at understanding foundations of statistical learning systems. In my free time, I enjoy cycling, social dance (especially swing!), violin, and conducting (orchestras, not electricity). </p>
		<p>Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions!</p>
